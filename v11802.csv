A Comparison of Word Embeddings for the Biomedical Natural Language  Processing"," Neural word embeddings have been widely used in biomedical Natural LanguageProcessing (NLP) applications since they provide vector representations ofwords that capture the semantic properties of words and the linguisticrelationship between words. Many biomedical applications use different textualsources to train word embeddings and apply these word embeddings to downstreambiomedical applications. However, there has been little work on comprehensivelyevaluating the word embeddings trained from these resources. In this study, weprovide a comprehensive empirical evaluation of word embeddings trained fromfour different resources, namely clinical notes, biomedical publications,Wikepedia, and news. We perform the evaluation qualitatively andquantitatively. In qualitative evaluation, we manually inspect five mostsimilar medical words to a given set of target medical words, and then analyzeword embeddings through the visualization of those word embeddings.Quantitative evaluation falls into two categories: extrinsic and intrinsicevaluation. Based on the evaluation results, we can draw the followingconclusions. First, EHR and PubMed can capture the semantics of medical termsbetter than GloVe and Google News and find more relevant similar medical terms.Second, the medical semantic similarity captured by the word embeddings trainedon EHR and PubMed are closer to human experts' judgments, compared to thesetrained on GloVe and Google News. Third, there does not exist a consistentglobal ranking of word embedding quality for downstream biomedical NLPapplications. However, adding word embeddings as extra features will improveresults on most downstream tasks. Finally, word embeddings trained from asimilar domain corpus do not necessarily have better performance than otherword embeddings for any downstream biomedical tasks.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.0400,"['/find/cs/1/au:+Wang_Y/0/1/0/all/0/1', '/find/cs/1/au:+Liu_S/0/1/0/all/0/1', '/find/cs/1/au:+Afzal_N/0/1/0/all/0/1', '/find/cs/1/au:+Rastegar_Mojarad_M/0/1/0/all/0/1', '/find/cs/1/au:+Wang_L/0/1/0/all/0/1', '/find/cs/1/au:+Shen_F/0/1/0/all/0/1', '/find/cs/1/au:+Liu_H/0/1/0/all/0/1']"

Bayesian Inference for Randomized Benchmarking Protocols"," Randomized benchmarking (RB) protocols are standard tools for characterizingquantum devices. Prior analyses of RB protocols have not provided a completemethod for analyzing realistic data, resulting in a variety of ad-hoc methods.The main confounding factor in rigorously analyzing data from RB protocols isan unknown and noise-dependent distribution of survival probabilities overrandom sequences. We propose a hierarchical Bayesian method where thesesurvival distributions are modeled as nonparametric Dirichlet process mixtures.Our method infers parameters of interest without additional assumptions aboutthe underlying physical noise process. We show with numerical examples that ourmethod works robustly for both standard and highly pathological error models.Our method also works reliably at low noise levels and with little data becausewe avoid the asymptotic assumptions of commonly used methods such asleast-squares fitting. For example, our method produces a narrow and consistentposterior for the average gate fidelity from ten random sequences per sequencelength in the standard RB protocol.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.0401,"['/find/quant-ph/1/au:+Hincks_I/0/1/0/all/0/1', '/find/quant-ph/1/au:+Wallman_J/0/1/0/all/0/1', '/find/quant-ph/1/au:+Ferrie_C/0/1/0/all/0/1', '/find/quant-ph/1/au:+Granade_C/0/1/0/all/0/1', '/find/quant-ph/1/au:+Cory_D/0/1/0/all/0/1']"

Formation of terrestrial planets in eccentric and inclined giant planet  systems"," Evidence of mutually inclined planetary orbits has been reported for giantplanets these last years. Here we aim to study the impact of eccentric andinclined massive giant planets on the terrestrial planet formation process, andinvestigate whether it can possibly lead to the existence of inclinedterrestrial planets. We have performed 126 simulations of the late-stageplanetary accretion in eccentric and inclined giant planet systems. Thephysical and orbital parameters of the giant planet systems result from n-bodysimulations of three giant planets in the late stage of the gas disc, under thecombined action of Type II migration and planet-planet scattering. Fourteentwo- and three-planet configurations have been selected, with diversifiedmasses, semi-major axes (resonant configurations or not), eccentricities andinclinations (including coplanar systems) at the dispersal of the gas disc. Wehave then followed the gravitational interactions of these systems with aninner disc of planetesimals and embryos (9 runs per system), studying in detailthe final configurations of the formed terrestrial planets. While coplanargiant systems harbour several terrestrial planets, generally as massive as theEarth and mainly on low eccentric and low inclined orbits, terrestrial planetsformed in systems with mutually inclined giant planets are usually fewer, lessmassive (<0.5 M_{\Earth}) and with larger eccentricities and inclinations. Thiswork shows that terrestrial planets can form on stable inclined orbits throughthe classical accretion theory, even in coplanar giant planet systems emergingfrom the disc phase.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.0403,"['/find/astro-ph/1/au:+Sotiriadis_S/0/1/0/all/0/1', '/find/astro-ph/1/au:+Libert_A/0/1/0/all/0/1', '/find/astro-ph/1/au:+Raymond_S/0/1/0/all/0/1']"

HOL Light QE"," We are interested in algorithms that manipulate mathematical expressions inmathematically meaningful ways.

Since the HOL logic is also a version ofChurch's type theory, we decided to add quotation and evaluation to HOL Lightto demonstrate the implementability of ${\rm CTT}_{\rm qe}$ and the benefits ofhaving quotation and evaluation in a proof assistant.

Two-color Fermi liquid theory for transport through a multilevel Kondo  impurity"," We consider a quantum dot with ${\cal K}{\geq} 2$ orbital levels occupied bytwo electrons connected to two electric terminals. The generic model is givenby a multi-level Anderson Hamiltonian. The weak-coupling theory at theparticle-hole symmetric point is governed by a two-channel $S{=}1$ Kondo modelcharacterized by intrinsic channels asymmetry. Based on a conformal fieldtheory approach we derived an effective Hamiltonian at a strong-coupling fixedpoint. The Hamiltonian capturing the low-energy physics of a two-stage Kondoscreening represents the quantum impurity by a two-color local Fermi-liquid.Using non-equilibrium (Keldysh) perturbation theory around the strong-couplingfixed point we analyze the transport properties of the model at finitetemperature, Zeeman magnetic field and source-drain voltage applied across thequantum dot. We compute the Fermi-liquid transport constants and discussdifferent universality classes associated with emergent symmetries.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.0407,"['/find/cond-mat/1/au:+Karki_D/0/1/0/all/0/1', '/find/cond-mat/1/au:+Mora_C/0/1/0/all/0/1', '/find/cond-mat/1/au:+Delft_J/0/1/0/all/0/1', '/find/cond-mat/1/au:+Kiselev_M/0/1/0/all/0/1']"

Discovery of New Dipper Stars with K2: A Window into the Inner Disk  Region of T Tauri Stars"," In recent years a new class of Young Stellar Object has been defined,referred to as dippers, where large transient drops in flux are observed. Thesedips are too large to be attributed to stellar variability, last from hours todays and can reduce the flux of a star by 10-50\%. This variability has beenattributed to occultations by warps or accretion columns near the inner edge ofcircumstellar disks. Here we present 95 dippers in the Upper Scorpiusassociation and $\rho$ Ophiuchus cloud complex found in K2 Campaign 2 datausing supervised machine learning with a Random Forest classifier. We alsopresent 30 YSOs that exhibit brightening events on the order of days, known asbursters. Not all dippers and bursters are known members, but all exhibitinfrared excesses and are consistent with belonging to either of the two youngstar forming regions. We find 21.0 $\pm$ 5.5\% of stars with disks are dippersfor both regions combined. Our entire dipper sample consists only of late-type(KM) stars, but we show that biases limit dipper discovery for earlier spectraltypes. Using the dipper properties as a proxy, we find that the temperature atthe inner disk edge is consistent with interferometric results for similar andearlier type stars.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.0409,"['/find/astro-ph/1/au:+Hedges_C/0/1/0/all/0/1', '/find/astro-ph/1/au:+Hodgkin_S/0/1/0/all/0/1', '/find/astro-ph/1/au:+Kennedy_G/0/1/0/all/0/1']"

Quantum-Enhanced Plasmonic Sensing"," Quantum resources can enhance the sensitivity of a device beyond theclassical shot noise limit and, as a result, revolutionize the field ofmetrology through the development of quantum-enhanced sensors. In particular,plasmonic sensors, which are widely used in biological and chemical sensingapplications, offer a unique opportunity to bring such an enhancement toreal-life devices. Here, we use bright entangled twin beams to enhance thesensitivity of a plasmonic sensor used to measure local changes in refractiveindex. We demonstrate a 56% quantum enhancement in the sensitivity ofstate-of-the-art plasmonic sensor with measured sensitivities on the order of$10^{-10}$RIU$/\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$, nearly 5 orders of magnitude better thanprevious proof-of-principle implementations of quantum-enhanced plasmonicsensors.

3D Object Dense Reconstruction from a Single Depth View"," In this paper, we propose a novel approach, 3D-RecGAN++, which reconstructsthe complete 3D structure of a given object from a single arbitrary depth viewusing generative adversarial networks. Unlike existing work which typicallyrequires multiple views of the same object or class labels to recover the full3D geometry, the proposed 3D-RecGAN++ only takes the voxel grid representationof a depth view of the object as input, and is able to generate the complete 3Doccupancy grid with a high resolution of 256^3 by recovering theoccluded/missing regions. The key idea is to combine the generativecapabilities of autoencoders and the conditional Generative AdversarialNetworks (GAN) framework, to infer accurate and fine-grained 3D structures ofobjects in high-dimensional voxel space. Extensive experiments on largesynthetic datasets and real-world Kinect datasets show that the proposed3D-RecGAN++ significantly outperforms the state of the art in single view 3Dobject reconstruction, and is able to reconstruct unseen types of objects.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.0411,"['/find/cs/1/au:+Yang_B/0/1/0/all/0/1', '/find/cs/1/au:+Rosa_S/0/1/0/all/0/1', '/find/cs/1/au:+Markham_A/0/1/0/all/0/1', '/find/cs/1/au:+Trigoni_N/0/1/0/all/0/1', '/find/cs/1/au:+Wen_H/0/1/0/all/0/1']"

Distributed Computing with Heterogeneous Communication Constraints: The  Worst-Case Computation Load and Proof by Contradiction"," We consider a distributed computing framework where the distributed nodeshave different communication capabilities, motivated by the heterogeneousnetworks in data centers and mobile edge computing systems. Following thestructure of MapReduce, this framework consists of Map computation phase,Shuffle phase, and Reduce computation phase. The Shuffle phase allowsdistributed nodes to exchange intermediate values, in the presence ofheterogeneous communication bottlenecks for different nodes (heterogeneouscommunication load constraints). Focusing on two-node and three-node (K=2, 3)distributed computing systems with heterogeneous communication loadconstraints, in this work we characterize the minimum total computation load,as well as the minimum worst-case computation load for some cases. Theworst-case computation load depends on the computation load of a node with theheaviest job. Therefore, by minimizing the worst-case computation load it couldpotentially minimize the system latency. We show an interesting insight that,for some cases, there is a tradeoff between the minimum total computation loadand the minimum worst-case computation load, in the sense that both cannot beachieved at the same time. The achievability schemes are proposed with carefuldesign on the file assignment and data shuffling. Finally, beyond the cut-setbound, a novel converse is proposed using the proof by contradiction.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.0413,"['/find/cs,math/1/au:+Shakya_N/0/1/0/all/0/1', '/find/cs,math/1/au:+Li_F/0/1/0/all/0/1', '/find/cs,math/1/au:+Chen_J/0/1/0/all/0/1']"

(Log-)epiperimetric inequality and regularity over smooth cones for  almost Area-Minimizing currents"," We prove a new logarithmic epiperimetric inequality for multiplicity-onestationary cones with isolated singularity by flowing in the radial directionany given trace along appropriately chosen directions. In contrast to previousepiperimetric inequalities for minimal surfaces (e.g. those of Reifenberg,Taylor and White), we need no a priori assumptions on the structure of the cone(e.g. integrability). Moreover, if the cone is integrable (not only throughrotations), we recover the classical epiperimetric inequality. As a consequencewe deduce a new $\varepsilon$-regularity result for almost area-minimizingcurrents at singular points, where at least one blow-up is a multiplicity-onecone with isolated singularity. This result is similar to the one forstationary varifolds of Leon Simon, but independent from it since almostminimizers do not satisfy any equation.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.0418,"['/find/math/1/au:+Engelstein_M/0/1/0/all/0/1', '/find/math/1/au:+Spolaor_L/0/1/0/all/0/1', '/find/math/1/au:+Velichkov_B/0/1/0/all/0/1']"

Phase diagram of the quantum Ising model with long-range interactions on  an infinite-cylinder triangular lattice"," Obtaining quantitative ground-state behavior for geometrically-frustratedquantum magnets with long-range interactions is challenging for numericalmethods.

We also present a way to theoretically realize some ofthese textures using $A_4$ symmetry within the framework of type-I+II seesawmechanism.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.0425,['/find/hep-ph/1/au:+Gautam_R/0/1/0/all/0/1']

New NLOPS predictions for $\boldsymbol{t\bar{t}+b}$-jet production at  the LHC"," Measurements of $t\bar{t} H$ production in the $H\to b\bar{b}$ channel dependin a critical way on the theoretical uncertainty associated with theirreducible $t\bar{t}+b$-jet background. In this paper, analysing the varioustopologies that account for $b$-jet production in association with a $t\bar{t}$pair, we demonstrate that the process at hand is largely driven by final-state$g\to b\bar{b}$ splittings. We also show that in five-flavour simulations basedon $t\bar{t}+$multi-jet merging $b$-jet production is mostly driven by theparton shower, while matrix elements play only a marginal role in thedescription of $g\to b\bar{b}$ splittings. Based on these observations weadvocate the use of NLOPS simulations of $pp\to t\bar{t}b\bar{b}$ in thefour-flavour scheme, and we present a new POWHEG generator of this kind.Predictions and uncertainties for $t\bar{t}+b$-jet observables at the 13 TeVLHC are presented both for the case of stable top quarks and withspin-correlated top decays. Besides QCD scale variations we consider alsotheoretical uncertainties related to the POWHEG matching method and to theparton shower modelling, with emphasis on $g\to b\bar{b}$ splittings. Ingeneral, matching and shower uncertainties turn out to be remarkably small.This is confirmed also by a tuned comparison against Sherpa+OpenLoops.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.0426,"['/find/hep-ph/1/au:+Jezo_T/0/1/0/all/0/1', '/find/hep-ph/1/au:+Lindert_J/0/1/0/all/0/1', '/find/hep-ph/1/au:+Moretti_N/0/1/0/all/0/1', '/find/hep-ph/1/au:+Pozzorini_S/0/1/0/all/0/1']"
27,"Title:
Boundary Conditions and Localization on AdS: Part 1"," We study the role of boundary conditions on the one loop partition functionof ${\cal N}=2$ chiral multiplet of R-charge $\Delta$ on $AdS_2\times S^1$. Thechiral multiplet is coupled to a background vector multiplet which preservessupersymmetry. We implement normalizable boundary conditions in $AdS_2$ anddevelop the Green's function method to obtain the one loop determinant. Weevaluate the one loop determinant for two different actions: the standardaction and the $Q$-exact deformed positive definite action used forlocalization. We show that if there exists an integer $n$ in the interval $D: (\frac{\Delta-1}{2L}, \frac{\Delta}{2L} )$, where $L$ being the ratio of radiusof $AdS_2$ to that of $S^1$, then the one loop determinants obtained for thetwo actions differ. It is in this situation that fields which obey normalizableboundary conditions do not obey supersymmetric boundary conditions. However ifthere are no integers in $D$, then fields which obey normalizable boundaryconditions also obey supersymmetric boundary conditions and the one loopdeterminants of the two actions precisely agree. We also show that it is onlyin the latter situation that the one loop determinant obtained by evaluatingthe index of the $D_{10}$ operator associated with the localizing action agreeswith the one loop determinant obtained using Green's function method.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.0427,"['/find/hep-th/1/au:+David_J/0/1/0/all/0/1', '/find/hep-th/1/au:+Gava_E/0/1/0/all/0/1', '/find/hep-th/1/au:+Gupta_R/0/1/0/all/0/1', '/find/hep-th/1/au:+Narain_K/0/1/0/all/0/1']"

To gauge or not to gauge?"," The D0 brane, or BFSS, matrix model is a quantum mechanical theory with aninteresting gravity dual. We consider a variant of this model where we treatthe $SU(N)$ symmetry as a global symmetry, rather than as a gauge symmetry.This variant contains new non-singlet states. We consider the impact of thesenew states on its gravity dual. We argue that the gravity dual is essentiallythe same as the one for the original matrix model.

Decay of standard model-like Higgs boson $h\rightarrow μτ$ in a  3-3-1 model with inverse seesaw neutrino masses"," By adding new gauge singlets of neutral leptons, improved versions of the3-3-1 models with right-handed neutrinos have been introduced recently toexplain recent experimental data of neutrino oscillation through the inverseseesaw mechanism. We will prove that these models predict promising signals oflepton flavor violating decays of the standard model like-Higgs boson$h^0_1\rightarrow \mu\tau,e\tau$, which are suppressed in the originalversions. One-loop contributions to these decay amplitudes are introduced inthe unitary gauge. Based on numerical investigation, we find that the branchingratios decays $h^0_1\rightarrow\mu\tau,e\tau$ can reach values of $10^{-5}$ inthe regions of the parameter space satisfying the current experimental data ofthe decay $\mu\rightarrow e\gamma$. The value of $10^{-4}$ appears when Yukawacouplings of leptons are close to the perturbative limit.

Linearized Binary Regression"," Probit regression was first proposed by Bliss in 1934 to study mortalityrates of insects. Since then, an extensive body of work has analyzed and usedprobit or related binary regression methods (such as logistic regression) innumerous applications and fields. This paper provides a fresh angle to suchwell-established binary regression methods. Concretely, we demonstrate thatlinearizing the probit model in combination with linear estimators performs onpar with state-of-the-art nonlinear regression methods, such as posterior meanor maximum aposteriori estimation, for a broad range of real-world regressionproblems. We derive exact, closed-form, and nonasymptotic expressions for themean-squared error of our linearized estimators, which clearly separates themfrom nonlinear regression methods that are typically difficult to analyze.

Coded Status Updates in an Energy Harvesting Erasure Channel"," We consider an energy harvesting transmitter sending status updates to areceiver over an erasure channel, where each status update is of length $k$symbols. The energy arrivals and the channel erasures are independent andidentically distributed (i.i.d.) and Bernoulli distributed in each slot. Inorder to combat the effects of the erasures in the channel and the uncertaintyin the energy arrivals, we use channel coding to encode the status updatesymbols. We consider two types of channel coding: maximum distance separable(MDS) codes and rateless erasure codes. For each of these models, we study twoachievable schemes: best-effort and save-and-transmit. In the best-effortscheme, the transmitter starts transmission right away, and sends a symbol ifit has energy. In the save-and-transmit scheme, the transmitter remains silentin the beginning in order to save some energy to minimize energy outages infuture slots. We analyze the average age of information (AoI) under each ofthese policies. We show through numerical results that as the average rechargerate decreases, MDS coding with save-and-transmit outperforms all best-effortschemes. We show that rateless coding with save-and-transmit outperforms allthe other schemes.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.0431,"['/find/cs,math/1/au:+Baknina_A/0/1/0/all/0/1', '/find/cs,math/1/au:+Ulukus_S/0/1/0/all/0/1']"

PhaseLin: Linear Phase Retrieval"," Phase retrieval deals with the recovery of complex- or real-valued signalsfrom magnitude measurements. As shown recently, the method PhaseMax enablesphase retrieval via convex optimization and without lifting the problem to ahigher dimension. To succeed, PhaseMax requires an initial guess of thesolution, which can be calculated via spectral initializers. In this paper, weshow that with the availability of an initial guess, phase retrieval can becarried out with an ever simpler, linear procedure. Our algorithm, calledPhaseLin, is the linear estimator that minimizes the mean squared error (MSE)when applied to the magnitude measurements. The linear nature of PhaseLinenables an exact and nonasymptotic MSE analysis for arbitrary measurementmatrices. We furthermore demonstrate that by iteratively using PhaseLin, onearrives at an efficient phase retrieval algorithm that performs on par withexisting convex and nonconvex methods on synthetic and real-world data.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.0432,"['/find/cs,math/1/au:+Ghods_R/0/1/0/all/0/1', '/find/cs,math/1/au:+Lan_A/0/1/0/all/0/1', '/find/cs,math/1/au:+Goldstein_T/0/1/0/all/0/1', '/find/cs,math/1/au:+Studer_C/0/1/0/all/0/1']"

Evolutionary Model Discovery of Factors for Farm Selection by the  Artificial Anasazi"," Agent-based modeling has been criticized for its apparent lack ofestablishing causality of social phenomena. However, we demonstrate that whencoupled with evolutionary computation techniques, agent-based models can beused to evolve plausible agent behaviors that are able to recreate patternsobserved in real-world data, from which valuable insights into candidateexplanations of the macro-phenomenon can be drawn. Existing methodologies havesuggested the manual assembly and comparison or automated selection ofpre-built models on their ability to fit patterns in data. We discuss the consof existing manual approaches and how evolutionary model discovery, anevolutionary approach to explore the space of agent behaviors for plausiblerule-sets, can overcome these issues. We couple evolutionary model discoverywith concepts from the Agent\_Zero framework, ensuring social connectivity,emotional theory components and rational mechanisms. In this study, we revisitthe farm-seeking strategy of the Artificial Anasazi model, originally designedto simply select the closest potential farm plot as their next farminglocation. We use evolutionary model discovery to explore plausible farm seekingstrategies, extending our previous study by testing four social connectivitystrategies, four emotional theory components and five rational mechanisms for amore complex human-like approach towards farm plot selection. Our resultsconfirm that, plot quality, dryness and community presence were more importantin the farm selection process of the Anasazi than distance, and discover farmselection strategies that generate simulations that produce a closer fit to thearchaeological data.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.0435,"['/find/cs/1/au:+Gunaratne_C/0/1/0/all/0/1', '/find/cs/1/au:+Garibay_I/0/1/0/all/0/1']"
36,"Title:
The effects of diffusion in hot subdwarf progenitors from the common  envelope channel"," Diffusion of elements in the atmosphere and envelope of a star candrastically alter its surface composition, leading to extreme chemicalpeculiarities. We consider the case of hot subdwarfs, where surface heliumabundances range from practically zero to almost 100 percent. Since hotsubdwarfs can form via a number of different evolution channels, a key questionconcerns how the formation mechanism is connected to the present surfacechemistry. A sequence of extreme horizontal branch star models was generated byproducing post-common envelope stars from red giants. Evolution was computedwith MESA from envelope ejection up to core-helium ignition. Surface abundanceswere calculated at the zero-age horizontal branch for models with and withoutdiffusion. A number of simulations also included radiative levitation. The goalwas to study surface chemistry during evolution from cool giant to hot subdwarfand determine when the characteristic subdwarf surface is established. Onlystars leaving the giant branch close to core-helium ignition becomehydrogen-rich subdwarfs at the zero-age horizontal branch. Diffusion, includingradiative levitation, depletes the initial surface helium in all cases. Allsubdwarf models rapidly become more depleted than observations allow. Surfaceabundances of other elements follow observed trends in general, but not indetail.
